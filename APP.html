            reduce the number of deaths and injuries that occur on the roads every year. We strongly believe that

                In congruence with the UN Road Safety Week from 3<sup>rd</sup> May 2015 to 10<sup>th</sup>
                May 2015, we collected over 3000 signatures from the citizens of Dehradun, India.
                At the end of the week, we held an awareness walk in Dehradun which was facilitated by the public
                authorities.

                spreading awareness throughout the non-literate strata of society- many of whose members are responsible for
                a large percentage of road accidents in India; due in part to their lack of formal driving practise.
